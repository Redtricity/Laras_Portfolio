          <h1>Hi! Iâ€™m <strong>Lara McIntyre</strong></h1>

          <p>
            Iâ€™m in my final Honours year of <strong>BSc Computer Games Development</strong>. 
            As a <strong>CODA</strong> (Child of Deaf Adults), Iâ€™m incredibly passionate about 
            building <strong>inclusive technologies</strong> that uplift all communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            My interests revolve around <strong>game development</strong>, 
            <strong> web development</strong>, and <strong>app development</strong>. Iâ€™m also a proud 
            <strong> GitHub Campus Expert ðŸš©</strong>, championing accessibility and diversity 
            in tech communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            I love creating games, websites, and immersive experiences that push creative 
            boundaries. Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me playing video games, spending time 
            with my family, and watching movies.
